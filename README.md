# CART315-Prototype02: Today, I'm an a**hole.
 
**Design Hypothesis**

In general, video games revolve around the story of a "hero" character that saves the world or is characterized as the good guy. But… What if we reverse the role and give the player the role of the vilain? Can the player still feel a sense of fulfillment and joy?

In this prototype, the player is portrayed as a cute little cat that woke up today and chose violence. The player has 60 seconds to make a complete mess of the human's kitchen. Some known issues to the current prototype: the cat gets propelled in the air when pushing an object. I also experimented with level design/world building. As much as I like cats, sometimes they can be assholes (I still love them).

**Questions**  

1.How did it feel to be the ~~asshole~~ “bad guy” in this story?

2.Was the environment convincing or did it feel unrealistic?

3.What did you think of the camera perspective where we can see the top of the cat’s head? Was it a nuisance to you?

4.Was 60 seconds a reasonable time to destroy a room? If not, would you make it longer or shorter?

5.How did the player controls feel (Keyboard + Mouse)? 

6.As you might have seen, the collision between the object propels the character up in the air. Did you find any other issues?

7.Something you would add to further improve the game experience?
