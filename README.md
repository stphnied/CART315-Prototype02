# Prototype 02

### Design Hypothesis

In general, video games revolve around the story of a "hero" character that saves the world or is characterized as the good guy. But… What if we reverse the role and give the player the role of the vilain? Can the player still feel a sense of fulfillment and joy?

In this prototype, the player is portrayed as a cute little cat that woke up today and chose violence. The player has 60 seconds to make a complete mess of the human's kitchen. Some known issues to the current prototype: the cat gets propelled in the air when pushing an object.

**Questions**  

1. How did it feel to be the “bad guy” in this story?

2. Was the environment convincing or did it feel unrealistic?

3. What did you think of the camera perspective where we can see the top of the cat’s head? Was it a nuisance to you?

4. Was 60 seconds a reasonable time to destroy a room? If not, would you make it longer or shorter?

5. How did the player controls feel (Keyboard + Mouse)? 

6. As you might have seen, the collision between the object propels the character up in the air. Did you find any other issues?

7. Something you would add to further improve the game experience?

### Feeback & Reflection

For the second prototype, I wanted to explore the idea of adding a narrative and setting that will allow the player to play as the “villain” but still feel a sense of accomplishment, and implementing a first person view with a third perspective aspect. Here are some discoveries that I have made from the playtest:

**Storyline**  
Overall, it seems like the general public liked the idea of playing as the bad guy and feasted on destroying the ludic space. One person even mentioned that it felt natural and they did not feel like the actual bad guy and had a good reasoning behind creating mayhem. I believe that imposing a story to a game will help build the gameworld and storyworld and allows the player to feel more immersed in the game.

**Camera**   
I wanted to try mixing two different perspectives in one camera to see if the player felt comfortable with this mix. To briefly summarize, it was a first-person view camera but the player were still able to see the cat’s ears. I wanted the player to still be able to see the model while playing. However, most playtesters expressed that although they like the idea, they would rather have either or. They mentioned they had a hard time seeing where they would lend because of the cat’s ears blocking the view. One playtester suggested sticking to a first-player camera and adding animated/walking paws on the screen when the kitty moves, which I think is a good way to still remind the player that they are playing as a cat. For the time being, I will stick to a simpler camera view.

**Time**  
Finding the right duration to allow the player to play and enjoy the game is tricky. I tried to estimate and balance it with the size of the room thus, giving only 60 seconds to the player. As the game developer, I already knew how to get by and what to do, however for a first time player, 60 seconds is not long enough for them to fully grasp the game. More than half of the playtesters have expressed that giving a bit more time would let the player get used to the environment and controls.

**Issues**  
Here are some issues that were mentioned by the playtesters:
- Collision boxes needing to be tighter with objects
- Sometimes at the beginning, it takes me some time to be able to move the cat
- Cannot see where you jump because of the cat’s head

**Improvements**
- Here are some suggestions made by the playtesters:
- Adding some sound effects
- Adding breaking animation to objects
- Adding more levels and rooms to destroy 
- Changing the timer color on the top
- Adding cutscenes
- Hiding from the human (to not get caught)
